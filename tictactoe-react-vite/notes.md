## Setup

- start with an empty square X button
- `styles.css` defines the styles for your React app
- first two CSS selectors `*` and `body` define the style of large parts of your app
- the `.square` selector defines the style of any component
  - where the `className` property is set to `square`
  - would match the button from your Square component
- `index.js` is a bridge between
  - the component you created in the `App.js` file
  - and the web browser
